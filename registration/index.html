<p> The details below <h5 style="color:red">have not been updated since 2023</h5>, but are provided for planning purposes. We anticipate having the registration working by the end of July 2024.</p>
<h1>Registration Process</h1>

<p>Registration for lodging and meals is due <b style="color:red">October 1</b>. After that date, you can still register to attend the conference (until <b style="color:red">October 10</b>), but on-site accommodations may no longer be available. A single Housing/Meals fee covers both accommodations and meals for the duration of the conference. A separate (and smaller) Conference Registration fee covers attendance at the scientific sessions.
